## CHAPTER 1: TYPES, VARIABLES, AND STANDARD I/O: LOST FORTUNE

### Introducing C++

- It's fast
- It's flexible
- It's well supported 

### Your first c++ program

- [game over](ch1/game_over.cc): hello world program
- [game over 2.0](ch1/game_over_2.0.cc): working with the std namesapce (1)
- [game over 3.0](ch1/game_over_3.0.cc): working with the std namesapce (2)

### Using arithmetics operators

- [expensive_calculator](expensive_calculator.cc): example of operations

### Declaring and initializing variables

A variable represents a particular piece of your computer’s memory that has been set aside for you to use to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

- [game_stats](ch1/game_stats.cc): using variables 

Every variable you create has a type, which represents the kind of information you can store in the variable.

*Fundamental types*—those built into the language—include **bool** for Boolean values (true or false), **char** for single character values, **int** for integers, **float** for single-precision floating point numbers, and **double** for double-precision floating point numbers.

You can use modifiers to alter a type. **short** is a modifier that can reduce the total number of values a variable can hold. **long** is a modifier that can increase the total number of values a variable can hold. **signed** and **unsigned** are modifiers that work only with integer types. signed means that a variable can store both positive and negative values, while unsigned means that a variable can store only positive values.

### Performing operations with variables
